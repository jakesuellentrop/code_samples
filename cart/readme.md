## Cart System

This is my implementation of a cart system for a project I'm currently working on. I am utilizing a 3rd party package for the cart logic, however the package methods didn't really fit my business logic how I liked (according to my interface at `Contracts\Cart\CartInterface.php`). To remedy this I wrote an adapter class, `Contracts\Cart\DdCartAdapter.php`, that implements my `CartInterface`. The adapter is still a work in progress, so not every method is fully built out. The adapter class uses dependency injection to resolve the current cart instance from the service container.

This same project was started using Laravel Jetstream as a foundation. As I built out the cart system, I wanted to continue to use the Jetstream design pattern of using "Action" classes that are resolved out of the service container. To do this, I built out the classes under `Actions\Cart` that provide different cart function implementations. In my service provider, each of these is mapped to an interface so that if need be, the implementations can be substituted.
